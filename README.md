Lecture notes based on Part IB Classical Dynamics

These are some notes based around the IB Classical Dynamics course, as taught by Dr D.A. Green in Michaelmas and Lent terms 2017-18 as part of Physics B in the Natural Sciences Tripos at Cambridge. In addition to the lectures and accompanying notes by the lecturer, I have also drawn upon lecture notes I took for the IA Dynamics and Relativity course in the Mathematical Tripos, as taught by Prof. G.I. Ogilvie in Lent 2017, and occasionally those taken by D.E. Chua for the same course by the same lecturer in Lent 2015.

Please note that these notes are not endorsed by the lecturer, and do not necessarily bear any relation to the course as it was taught.
